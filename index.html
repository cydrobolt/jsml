            <p class="jm-pad-bottom-1">Some questions that students and parents ask frequently.</p>

            <b>How will coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions affect JumpStart sessions?</b> <!-- new spring 2020 -->

            <p class="jm-left">We are building on our experience with Zoom from 2020, 2021, and 2022.  We have Zoomed with almost 300 students since the start of the pandemic  
                and are confident that this will continue to work well in the future.  <i>The success of your essay remains our promise and our priority.</i>
            </p>    

            <b>What work will be accomplished at JumpStart Main Line?</b>

            <p class="jm-left">
                Students come to Zoom class on Day 1 with nothing.  We take you through introductions to this type of
                writing, some examples, and idea-generation exercises, and then you write and conference,
                conference and write.
            </p>
            <p class="jm-left">
                During in-person classes (2013-2019), over 75% of our students left after four days with their Common App 
                essay completed.  The remaining 25% were able to email with us until the end of July with questions and revisions.  
                For the summers of 2020 through 2022 on Zoom, the first-week completion rate rose to almost 85%.  Conferences occur one-on-one in Zoom  
                breakout rooms, mainly over shared on-line documents.
            </p> 
            <p class="jm-left">
                We still expect that a student who focuses on their essay can have a complete, edited document ready by the end of the 
                four-day session.  If it takes a little longer, we will of course continue to work with you until the end of July, if necessary, 
                to make sure the essay is done to your satisfaction.
            </p>

            <b>What if I am applying to a non-Common App college?</b>

            <p class="jm-left">
                JumpStart’s teachers will work with you on a college essay of your choice –- the Common App is
                simply the most...well, <i>common</i>.  Well-named, as it turns out!  Schools that do not use the Common App often 
                require a personal statement or offer another prompt that is very similar to one of the Common App prompts.  
                We have had students complete non-Common App essays every year, including those for the (relatively new) 
                Coalition for Access, Affordability, and Success.
            </p>

            <b>What are the hours for the course?</b>

            <p class="jm-left">
                Morning sessions start at 9:00 a.m.; evening sessions start at 4:30 p.m.  Expect approximately 90 minutes 
                on instruction and topic-generation exercises on Day 1, followed by individual conferences with each student; expect 
                approximately 60 minutes on instruction and strategy on Day 2, followed by individual conferences with each student; 
                after that, one-on-one conferences will keep happening until the essay is done.  This is an iterative process, so 
                we expect several loops of writing, feedback, editing/writing, feedback, editing/writing, etc.  At 2.5 hours per day for 
                four days, the session lasts a total of 10 hours.

                We have done one-on-one essay tutoring every year; the schedule will be worked out to be mutually convenient to you and the JSML tutor.  
                The price for one-on-one tutoring is $1000, to cover as many meetings as necessary for you to get to a complete Common App essay that satisfies you.
            </p>


            <b>How large are the classes?</b>

            <p class="jm-left">
                The student-teacher ratio is no greater than 4:1.  At least two teachers (and maybe all of us) will 
                be present in any session, to make sure that each student receives feedback from multiple readers. 
            </p>

            <b>Does the course have one-on-one or group instruction?</b>

            <p class="jm-left">
                Both!  We open with group instruction for introduction, context, and idea-generation
                exercises, but even on Day 1 we meet one-on-one with each student.  Day 2: some group instruction plus more 
                one-on-one meetings.  After that, it is all one-on-one until the essay is done. 
            </p>

            <b>How much does the camp course cost?</b>

            <p class="jm-left">
                The camp costs $600 for the session, including all instruction, conferencing, and editing.  Inflation begone: our price for 2023 is the same as it was for 2022! (One-on-one tutoring does cost more, of course.)
            </p>

            <!-- Pre-Zoom language:
            <b>Do I have to bring a laptop computer?</b>

            <p class="jm-left">
                No, but of course you can. Many students do.  We even prefer to do some of the early work with good old-fashioned paper and pen -– which we provide.  
                Eventually, you’re going to want to word-process, but you can certainly type at home, print up a draft, and bring in the paper copy to
                conference over and add to.
            </p> -->

            <b>Where does JumpStart Main Line meet?</b>

            <p class="jm-left">
                Online, in the video-conferencing app Zoom.  You don't have to download any software, 
                but we'll reach out to you to check technical specifications.  We'll email you an invitation link shortly 
                before your session begins.

                                        Wright are very good at developing an essay with a student rather than writing it for them.

                                        This program potentially saved a lot of fighting and anguish in the Fall in the Lee household.  Now we don't have to nag our son about finishing his essay, just his college
                                        application.  Because my son is a perfectionist, it would have taken him months to write an essay
                                        that is true to him.  JSML camp is a gem in our community.  I tell all my friends with HS students about it.

                                        [My oldest son, Niko,] participated in the JSML essay camp
                                        with Mr. Wright and Mr. Rosin last summer.  Niko, a reluctant writer, took pride and ownership
                                        while working on his essay.  It was very encouraging to see him want to share his piece of writing
                                        with us. He continued to revisit his essay, add details and edit his piece.  Mr. Wright and Mr.
                                        Rosin encouraged him to email them his ideas and corrections even after his session was over. 
                                        Jack will be there this summer for sure! All junior parents should consider!

                                        Thank you for running such a fabulous camp.  Will was accepted ED to Trinity College and handwritten on the bottom of the letter was a note saying how much they loved reading his essay about his passion for the cinema.
